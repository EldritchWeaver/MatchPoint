**MatchPoint API** is a complete and robust backend solution for managing sports and eSports tournaments. Built with FastAPI, it provides a comprehensive set of features to handle the entire lifecycle of a tournament, from user registration to match result tracking.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **User Management**: Secure user registration, authentication with JWT, and profile management.
-   **Team Management**: Create and manage teams, with a designated captain for each.
-   **Member Management**: Assign users to teams with specific roles (player, captain, substitute).
-   **Tournament Management**: Detailed tournament setup, including dates, descriptions, and team capacity.
-   **Inscriptions**: Seamlessly manage team registrations for tournaments.
-   **Payment Processing**: Track and confirm payments for tournament inscriptions.
-   **Match Scheduling**: Organize and manage match schedules and record results.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is divided into a `backend` built with FastAPI and a `frontend` console application for interacting with the API.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the `back` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd back
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend (Console App)

1.  **Navigate to the `front` directory**:
    ```bash
    cd front
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```

## 📚 API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at the following endpoints when the server is running:

-   **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
-   **ReDoc**: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

### API Endpoints

A summary of the available endpoints:

#### Users (`/users`)

-   `POST /`: Create a new user.
-   `POST /token`: Authenticate and receive a JWT token.
-   `GET /`: Get a list of all users.
-   `GET /{user_id}`: Get a user by their ID.
-   `GET /nickname/{nickname}`: Get a user by their nickname.
-   `PUT /{user_id}`: Update a user's information.
-   `DELETE /{user_id}`: Delete a user.

#### Teams (`/teams`)

-   `POST /`: Create a new team.
-   `GET /`: Get a list of all teams.
-   `GET /{team_id}`: Get a team by its ID.
-   `PUT /{team_id}`: Update a team's information.
-   `DELETE /{team_id}`: Delete a team.

... (and so on for all the other endpoints)

## 🗃️ Database

The application uses **SQLite** for its database. The database is automatically created and initialized in the `back` directory as `app_db.db` when the application starts for the first time.

The database schema includes tables for `usuarios`, `equipos`, `miembros_equipo`, `torneos`, `inscripciones`, `pagos`, and `partidos`, with all the necessary relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity.

## 🧪 Testing

A Postman collection is included at `back/postman_collection.json` for easy testing of all API endpoints.

1.  Open Postman.
2.  Click on "Import" and select the `postman_collection.json` file.
3.  You can now send requests to the API and see the responses.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend

-   **FastAPI**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It's built on Starlette and Pydantic, and provides automatic data validation, serialization, and interactive documentation.
-   **Pydantic**: A data validation and settings management library using Python type hints. It's used to define the data schemas for the API.
-   **Uvicorn**: A lightning-fast ASGI server, used to run the FastAPI application.
-   **python-jose**: A library for encoding, decoding, and verifying JWTs, used for user authentication.
-   **passlib** & **bcrypt**: Libraries for securely hashing and verifying passwords.
-   **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless, self-contained, transactional SQL database engine.

### Frontend (Future Implementation)

The current console-based frontend will be replaced with a full-featured mobile application built with the following technologies:

-   **React Native**: A popular framework for building native mobile apps using JavaScript and React.
-   **Expo**: A platform that simplifies React Native development, providing tools and services to build, deploy, and iterate on your apps.
-   **Gluestack UI**: A component library that provides a set of accessible, themeable, and production-ready components to build your UI quickly.

This stack was chosen for its ability to deliver a high-quality, native-like user experience on both iOS and Android from a single codebase, significantly reducing development time and effort.

## 🔮 Future Implementations

-   **Real-time notifications**: Use WebSockets to send real-time notifications to users about match updates, tournament news, etc.
-   **User profiles with statistics**: Add more detailed user profiles with statistics, match history, and achievements.
-   **Advanced tournament formats**: Implement more complex tournament formats, such as double elimination, round robin, etc.
-   **Social features**: Add social features like friend lists, private messaging, and team chat.
-   **Payment gateway integration**: Integrate a payment gateway to automate the payment process for tournament inscriptions.
